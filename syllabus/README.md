## Course Description

Designed to cover and compare a variety of programmable logic devices with design
examples to show their applications. It emphasizes the implementation of digital
systems with programmable logic devices using VHDL as design description
language and Xilinx Vivado software for design simulation and verification.

## Prerequisite by Topic:

Students must be familiar with conventional techniques in designing digital logic
circuit using discrete logic. Specifically, they must be familiar with conversion of
numbers among various number systems, TTL input/output voltage and current
specification, logic function minimization, timing analysis, and functions of standard
MSI combinational and sequential circuits such as decoder, multiplexer, encoder,
comparator, adder, subtractor, flip-flops, shift registers, and counters. This is an
elective course for EE and required course for CompE.

## Grading:

Final grades will be based on the total of points earned on the projects, homework,
and exams. All class assignments are supposed to be done individually but group
study and discussing the sample exams, assignments, etc. are encouraged. The grade
distribution is as follows:

- Homework Assignments: 35%
- Midterm Exam: 30 %
- Final Exam (Cumulative): 35%

The Canvas and GitHub-classroom website will be the main source of information for the course. Canvas
will be used for announcements, and sharing assignment links. GitHub will be used to submit assignments
and codding discussions. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to check class website frequently for due
dates and announcements, download and print the necessary documents needed in
the course.

**Grade letter assignment:**  

1. 90% - 100% A
1. 85% - 89% A-
1. 80% - 84% B+
1. 75% - 79% B
1. 70% - 74% B-
1. 65% - 69% C+

1. 50% - 54% D+
1. 45% - 49% D
1. 40% - 44% D-
1. 0% - 39% F

**Grading Notes:**  
1. All assignments must be done individually. However group study and
discussion are highly encouraged.
2. Students are called randomly to present their assignments on special
sessions that will be announced. Failing to present your work will cause
receiving no credit for the assignment. This includes all assignments.
3. Homework/Computer assignments due dates are posted on GitHub classroom
and must be submitted via GitHub. Late assignments/labs will not be
accepted after the due date and cannot be submitted online under no
circumstances. Please pay attention to all due dates very closely. Submission
of the assignments by email will receive no credit. Assignments due dates
will not be extended once set.
4. Please pay attention to all due dates very closely. It is extremely important
to be on time with all assignments. This is the best way to succeed and
receive a good grade for the course.
5. Please make sure your work is not shared with any other students. In case of
similar submission, all parties involve will receive no credit for the
assignment for the first time and if repeated there will be no credit for the
course.
